\item{mode}{string}

\item{target_idx}{vector}

\description{
For a given graph \code{g} (igraph object) and a threshold \code{threshold}
(number between 0 and 1), find the largest set of nodes such that
the number of edges among this set of nodes in \code{g} is at least
\code{threshold} percentage of a full clique.
}
\details{
This is returned as a list of indices, so if there are multiple largest sets
of the same size, the list will have multiple set of indices.

\code{mode} is either "all" or "or". "all" is an approximate form that enables
faster computing, but "or" gives exact answers.

If \code{target_idx} is not \code{NA}, then maximal cliques are pruned based on
their overlap with \code{target_idx} and its length. And after the algorithm,
indices in \code{target_idx} are seen if they can be filled in heuristically.
