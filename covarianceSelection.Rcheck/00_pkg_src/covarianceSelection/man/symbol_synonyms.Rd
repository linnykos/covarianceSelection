\description{
This function is an in-house way to map genes to their most commonly-known form
based on the \code{org.Hs.eg.db} package. If there are conflicts (i.e., multiple
genes that claim to be the official alias of a gene), we take the most "common" gene (i.e.,
how often it appears as the official gene). If there are still ties, we take the 
first gene alphabetically.
}
\details{
If no genes are found for a particular gene character, return \code{character(0)}.

At the time of this function's writing, we are using version 3.8.2 of the \code{org.Hs.eg.db} package.
