\usage{
screen(dat, pv, p_thres = 0.1, num_genes = 3500)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{the nxd matrix}

\item{pv}{vector of d pvalues}

\item{p_thres}{numeric}

\item{num_genes}{numeric}
}
\value{
list of primary and secondary genes, each a vector of integers
between 1 and \code{ncol(dat)}
}
\description{
We use a screening method where genes with \code{pv} lower than
\code{p_thres} are primary genes, and the secondary genes are selected based on having the having
highest
(absolute) Pearson correlation with any of the primary genes
such that there are \code{num_genes} total.
