\title{Add new elements to a queue}
\usage{
.add_to_queue(queue, new_len, elements, children, hash_children,
  hash_unique, hash_history, d, mode = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{queue}{\code{queue} object}

\item{new_len}{positive integer}

\item{elements}{indices of the new node to be added}

\item{children}{vector}

\item{hash_children}{\code{hash} object}

\item{hash_unique}{\code{hash} object}

\item{hash_history}{\code{hash} object}

\item{d}{maximum value in \code{elements}}

\item{mode}{string}
}
\value{
a vector, stating how many things were attempted to be pushed and how many things were actually pushed
}
\description{
This function pushes the strings formed by any integer less than \code{new_len}
and \code{new_len} onto the queue.
}
\details{
Recall, since \code{queue} is using \code{dequer}'s implementation, it is
passed by reference.
